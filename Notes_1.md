- React came out in 2013
- people starting building big sites with jquery. Now to manage these big sites tools like backbonejs came up to organize. now it slowly progressed to single page apps,where as the app is loaded only once. This led to angular and modularizing the app and split code to small components. Now more and more components needs to be handled and is being interacted with each other. Also data was flowing every where between components and difficult to debug as a result.So a f/w was built to organize components, design data flow and storage, leading to birth of react.

**React Concepts**
- Dont touch DOM directly. React will do it for us. Changing dom direclty based on user input is Imperative approach.
