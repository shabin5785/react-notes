- React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you canâ€™t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time. With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

-React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

- Always start component names with a capital letter.React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, <div /> represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.

- Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

-State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

- Do Not Modify State Directly, use setState. 
- State Updates May Be Asynchronous.React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.
