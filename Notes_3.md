- React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you canâ€™t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time. With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

-React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
